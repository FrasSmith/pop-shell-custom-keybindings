# pop-shell-custom-keybindings

I came to Pop!_shell from a Regolith/i3 background and I wasn't comfortable with the default Pop!_shell keybindings.

So I created a bash script to make my life a little bit easier.

Most of these keybindings can be modified using the gnome settings program or dconf editor, but this script ties them all to a single location and makes bulk updating much faster.

Note: Use this at your own risk. There is no undo. If you don't like the results, you can reset all bindings in the gnome settings program.
